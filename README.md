# SAMP_items
Plugin that manages items (creation is included)

# Short explanation

In your script, you must first create a ItemSchema to be a model for all items you want to create.
You must set a name, a modelID, and a type (it's a simple number).

After, you can create items. Set item positions and rotations, and show it !

# Build
SAMPGDK4 in a static version is required (there's one in the source folder, ready to use).

Next, you should launch CMake and try to generate sources. After that, compile the plugin with generated files !
